So I just made a bowl of **Xtraa Hot Cheeto's Mac'n Cheese** and God, it is so horrible. Like it's tasteless, only spice, no actual flavor. On top of that it just tasted like cheesy milk at the bottom.

Tasting Notes:

- First Bite: Okay, not much taste
- Too much spice not enough flavor
- A little too buttery
- Help, I need help, milk is wayyy to cheesy.
- Gave me a stomach ache

So long story short, do **NOT** buy this food product unless you want to have a bad time and although I haven't reached this particular stage yet I imagine it won't be good for bathroom time.
